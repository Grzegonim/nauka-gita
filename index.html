        <h1>Taarlo</h1>
        <p>We walk, the two of us, through the autumn day.<br>
            And in spring too I feel no different.<br>
            We walk through much brown tavern-brown of leaves<br>
            through much dark-red loss, appellation controlée,</p>
        <p>that deepens in the cellar of the years.<br>
            We walk through the beiger-turning woods of Drente.<br>
            Hear the wind passing through the hennaed trees<br>
            sounding like an oboe, tramp among instruments.</p>
        <p>33, and in the midst of the dark wood<br>
            of life. And with a sense of nowhere belonging,<br>
            at home in the woods and desolate at home.</p>
        <p>Will we one day, maybe, ever?<br>
            The summer is past, the hay-making is over.<br>
            The here is nowhere, and the now is never.</p>
